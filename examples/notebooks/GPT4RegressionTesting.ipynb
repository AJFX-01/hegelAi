However, since 5^2 (25) is greater than 17, we don't need to check any further.

In other words, if a number is prime, it can't be divided evenly by any other numbers except for 1 and itself.\\n\\nSo, to determine if 17 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and 17.\\n\\nLet's start with 2. 17 divided by 2 gives us a quotient of 8 and a remainder of 1. So, 2 is not a divisor of 17.\\n\\nNext, we'll try 3. 17 divided by 3 gives us a quotient of 5 and a remainder of 2. So, 3 is not a divisor of 17.\\n\\nWe can continue this process, but there's a shortcut we can use. We only need to check divisors up to the square root of 17, which is approximately 4.12. This is because any factor larger than this would have to be paired with a factor smaller than this to multiply to 17, and we would have already found that smaller factor.\\n\\nSo, we only need to check 4.

To do this, we can perform the division: 17 ÷ 2 = 8 with a remainder of 1. Since there's a remainder, 17 is not divisible by 2.\\n\\nStep 3: Move on to the next smallest prime number, which is 3. Check if 17 can be divided by 3 without leaving a remainder. Perform the division: 17 ÷ 3 ≈ 5.67. Since this is not a whole number, 17 is not divisible by 3.\\n\\nStep 4: Continue this process with the next smallest prime number, which is 5. However, since 5^2 (25) is greater than 17, we don't need to check any further. This is because if 17 had any factors greater than 5, it would also have to have factors smaller than 5 to multiply together to equal 17.

       "12  Sure, let's determine if 17 is a prime number.\\n\\nA prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. In other words, if a number is prime, it can't be divided evenly by any other numbers except for 1 and itself.\\n\\nSo, to determine if 17 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and 17.\\n\\nLet's start with 2. 17 divided by 2 gives us a quotient of 8 and a remainder of 1. So, 2 is not a divisor of 17.\\n\\nNext, we'll try 3. 17 divided by 3 gives us a quotient of 5 and a remainder of 2. So, 3 is not a divisor of 17.\\n\\nWe can continue this process, but there's a shortcut we can use. We only need to check divisors up to the square root of 17, which is approximately 4.12. This is because any factor larger than this would have to be paired with a factor smaller than this to multiply to 17, and we would have already found that smaller factor.\\n\\nSo, we only need to check 4. But 17 divided by 4 gives us a quotient of 4 and a remainder of 1. So, 4 is not a divisor of 17.\\n\\nSince we've checked all possible divisors up to the square root of 17 and found none, we can conclude that 17 is a prime number.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "13  To determine if a number is prime, we need to understand what a prime number is. A prime number is a number that has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. In other words, the only way to multiply two numbers to get a prime number is to multiply 1 by the number itself.\\n\\nNow, let's consider the number 45. \\n\\nFirst, we know that 1 and 45 are two numbers that can multiply together to give 45. \\n\\nBut let's see if there are any other pairs of numbers that can multiply together to give 45. \\n\\nWe can start by checking if 45 is divisible by 2. It's not, because 45 is an odd number. \\n\\nNext, we can check if 45 is divisible by 3. It is, because 3*15 equals 45. \\n\\nSo, we've found another pair of numbers (3 and 15) that can multiply together to give 45. \\n\\nThis means that 45 has more than two distinct positive divisors (1, 3, 5, 9, 15, and 45), so it is not a prime number.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "14  To determine if a number is prime, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. A prime number is a number that has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. \\n\\nFor the number 17077, we can start by checking if it's divisible by the smallest prime numbers like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and so on. \\n\\nFirst, we can see that 17077 is an odd number, so it's not divisible by 2. \\n\\nNext, we can check if it's divisible by 3. A quick way to do this is to add up the digits of the number (1+7+0+7+7 = 22) and see if the sum is divisible by 3. 22 is not divisible by 3, so 17077 is not divisible by 3.\\n\\nWe can then check if it's divisible by 5. Any number that ends in 0 or 5 is divisible by 5, and since 17077 does not end in 0 or 5, it's not divisible by 5.\\n\\nNext, we can check if it's divisible by 7. There's no simple rule for divisibility by 7, so we can do the division and see if there's a remainder. When we divide 17077 by 7, we get a quotient of 2439 and a remainder of 4. So, 17077 is not divisible by 7.\\n\\nWe can continue this process with the next prime numbers, but to save time, we can use a shortcut. We only need to check divisibility up to the square root of the number. The square root of 17077 is about 130.67. So, we only need to check divisibility by prime numbers up to 131.\\n\\nIf we continue checking divisibility by prime numbers up to 131 and find that 17077 is not divisible by any of them, then 17077 is a prime number. However, if we find that 17077 is divisible by any of these prime numbers, then it's not a prime number.\\n\\nAfter checking, we find that 17077 is divisible by 59 (17077 / 59 = 289), so 17077 is not a prime number.                                                 \n",

In other words, the only way to multiply two numbers to get a prime number is to multiply 1 by the number itself.\\n\\nNow, let's consider the number 26. \\n\\nThe first step is to see if 26 can be divided evenly by 2, which is the smallest prime number. If it can, then 26 is not a prime number. \\n\\n26 divided by 2 equals 13, which is a whole number. This means that 26 can be divided evenly by numbers other than 1 and itself, specifically 2 and 13. \\n\\nTherefore, 26 is not a prime number because it has more than two distinct positive divisors: 1, 2, 13, and 26.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

So, 2 is not a divisor of 17.\\n\\nNext, we'll try 3. 17 divided by 3 is approximately 5.67, which is also not a whole number. So, 3 is not a divisor of 17.\\n\\nWe can continue this process, but there's a shortcut we can use. We only need to check numbers up to the square root of 17, which is approximately 4.12. This is because any factor larger than this would have to be paired with a factor smaller than this to multiply to 17, and we've already checked all those smaller numbers.\\n\\nSo, we only need to check 4. 17 divided by 4 is 4.25, which is not a whole number.

A prime number is a number that has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. \\n\\nFor the number 17077, we can start by checking if it's divisible by the smallest prime numbers like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and so on. \\n\\nFirst, we can see that 17077 is an odd number, so it's not divisible by 2. \\n\\nNext, we can check if it's divisible by 3. To do this, we can add up the digits of the number (1+7+0+7+7 = 22) and see if the result is divisible by 3. Since 22 is not divisible by 3, 17077 is also not divisible by 3.\\n\\nThen, we can check if it's divisible by 5. Any number that ends in 0 or 5 is divisible by 5, and since 17077 does not end in 0 or 5, it's not divisible by 5.\\n\\nNext, we can check if it's divisible by 7. Unfortunately, there's no simple rule for divisibility by 7, so we would have to do the division. When we divide 17077 by 7, we get a quotient of 2439 and a remainder of 4, so 17077 is not divisible by 7.\\n\\nWe can continue this process with the next prime numbers, but to save time, we can use a shortcut. We only need to check divisibility up to the square root of the number. The square root of 17077 is about 130.67, so we only need to check divisibility by primes up to 131.\\n\\nIf we continue checking divisibility by primes up to 131 and find that 17077 is not divisible by any of them, then 17077 is a prime number. However, if we find that 17077 is divisible by any of these primes, then 17077 is not a prime number.\\n\\nAfter checking, we find that 17077 is divisible by 59 and 289. Therefore, 17077 is not a prime number.                                                                           \n",

This means that 2 and 13 are also divisors of 26.\\n\\nSince we found more divisors other than 1 and 26 itself, we can conclude that 26 is not a prime number.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

To do this, we can perform the division: 17 ÷ 2 = 8 with a remainder of 1. Since there's a remainder, 17 is not divisible by 2.\\n\\nStep 3: Move on to the next smallest prime number, which is 3.

However, since 5^2 (25) is greater than 17, we don't need to check any further.

To do this, we can perform the division: 17 ÷ 2 = 8 with a remainder of 1. Since there's a remainder, 17 is not divisible by 2.\\n\\nStep 3: Move on to the next smallest prime number, which is 3. Check if 17 can be divided by 3 without leaving a remainder. Perform the division: 17 ÷ 3 ≈ 5.67. Since this is not a whole number, 17 is not divisible by 3.\\n\\nStep 4: Continue this process with the next smallest prime number, which is 5. However, since 5^2 (25) is greater than 17, we don't need to check any further. This is because if 17 had any factors greater than 5, it would also have to have factors smaller than 5 to multiply together to equal 17.

       "12  Sure, let's determine if 17 is a prime number.\\n\\nA prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. In other words, if a number is prime, it can't be divided evenly by any other numbers except for 1 and itself.\\n\\nSo, to determine if 17 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and 17.\\n\\nLet's start with 2. 17 divided by 2 gives us a quotient of 8 and a remainder of 1. So, 2 is not a divisor of 17.\\n\\nNext, we'll try 3. 17 divided by 3 gives us a quotient of 5 and a remainder of 2. So, 3 is not a divisor of 17.\\n\\nWe can continue this process, but there's a shortcut we can use. We only need to check divisors up to the square root of 17, which is approximately 4.12. This is because any factor larger than this would have to be paired with a factor smaller than this to multiply to 17, and we would have already found that smaller factor.\\n\\nSo, we only need to check 4. But 17 divided by 4 gives us a quotient of 4 and a remainder of 1. So, 4 is not a divisor of 17.\\n\\nSince we've checked all possible divisors up to the square root of 17 and found none, we can conclude that 17 is a prime number.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "13  To determine if a number is prime, we need to understand what a prime number is. A prime number is a number that has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. In other words, the only way to multiply two numbers to get a prime number is to multiply 1 by the number itself.\\n\\nNow, let's consider the number 45. \\n\\nFirst, we know that 1 and 45 are two numbers that can multiply together to give 45. \\n\\nBut let's see if there are any other pairs of numbers that can multiply together to give 45. \\n\\nWe can start by checking if 45 is divisible by 2. It's not, because 45 is an odd number. \\n\\nNext, we can check if 45 is divisible by 3. It is, because 3*15 equals 45. \\n\\nSo, we've found another pair of numbers (3 and 15) that can multiply together to give 45. \\n\\nThis means that 45 has more than two distinct positive divisors (1, 3, 5, 9, 15, and 45), so it is not a prime number.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "14  To determine if a number is prime, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. A prime number is a number that has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. \\n\\nFor the number 17077, we can start by checking if it's divisible by the smallest prime numbers like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and so on. \\n\\nFirst, we can see that 17077 is an odd number, so it's not divisible by 2. \\n\\nNext, we can check if it's divisible by 3. A quick way to do this is to add up the digits of the number (1+7+0+7+7 = 22) and see if the sum is divisible by 3. 22 is not divisible by 3, so 17077 is not divisible by 3.\\n\\nWe can then check if it's divisible by 5. Any number that ends in 0 or 5 is divisible by 5, and since 17077 does not end in 0 or 5, it's not divisible by 5.\\n\\nNext, we can check if it's divisible by 7. There's no simple rule for divisibility by 7, so we can do the division and see if there's a remainder. When we divide 17077 by 7, we get a quotient of 2439 and a remainder of 4. So, 17077 is not divisible by 7.\\n\\nWe can continue this process with the next prime numbers, but to save time, we can use a shortcut. We only need to check divisibility up to the square root of the number. The square root of 17077 is about 130.67. So, we only need to check divisibility by prime numbers up to 131.\\n\\nIf we continue checking divisibility by prime numbers up to 131 and find that 17077 is not divisible by any of them, then 17077 is a prime number. However, if we find that 17077 is divisible by any of these prime numbers, then it's not a prime number.\\n\\nAfter checking, we find that 17077 is divisible by 59 (17077 / 59 = 289), so 17077 is not a prime number.                                                 \n",

In other words, the only way to multiply two numbers to get a prime number is to multiply 1 by the number itself.\\n\\nNow, let's consider the number 26. \\n\\nThe first step is to see if 26 can be divided evenly by 2, which is the smallest prime number. If it can, then 26 is not a prime number. \\n\\n26 divided by 2 equals 13, which is a whole number. This means that 26 can be divided evenly by numbers other than 1 and itself, specifically 2 and 13. \\n\\nTherefore, 26 is not a prime number because it has more than two distinct positive divisors: 1, 2, 13, and 26.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

So, 2 is not a divisor of 17.\\n\\nNext, we'll try 3. 17 divided by 3 is approximately 5.67, which is also not a whole number. So, 3 is not a divisor of 17.\\n\\nWe can continue this process, but there's a shortcut we can use. We only need to check numbers up to the square root of 17, which is approximately 4.12. This is because any factor larger than this would have to be paired with a factor smaller than this to multiply to 17, and we've already checked all those smaller numbers.\\n\\nSo, we only need to check 4. 17 divided by 4 is 4.25, which is not a whole number.

A prime number is a number that has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. \\n\\nFor the number 17077, we can start by checking if it's divisible by the smallest prime numbers like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and so on. \\n\\nFirst, we can see that 17077 is an odd number, so it's not divisible by 2. \\n\\nNext, we can check if it's divisible by 3. To do this, we can add up the digits of the number (1+7+0+7+7 = 22) and see if the result is divisible by 3. Since 22 is not divisible by 3, 17077 is also not divisible by 3.\\n\\nThen, we can check if it's divisible by 5. Any number that ends in 0 or 5 is divisible by 5, and since 17077 does not end in 0 or 5, it's not divisible by 5.\\n\\nNext, we can check if it's divisible by 7. Unfortunately, there's no simple rule for divisibility by 7, so we would have to do the division. When we divide 17077 by 7, we get a quotient of 2439 and a remainder of 4, so 17077 is not divisible by 7.\\n\\nWe can continue this process with the next prime numbers, but to save time, we can use a shortcut. We only need to check divisibility up to the square root of the number. The square root of 17077 is about 130.67, so we only need to check divisibility by primes up to 131.\\n\\nIf we continue checking divisibility by primes up to 131 and find that 17077 is not divisible by any of them, then 17077 is a prime number. However, if we find that 17077 is divisible by any of these primes, then 17077 is not a prime number.\\n\\nAfter checking, we find that 17077 is divisible by 59 and 289. Therefore, 17077 is not a prime number.                                                                           \n",

This means that 2 and 13 are also divisors of 26.\\n\\nSince we found more divisors other than 1 and 26 itself, we can conclude that 26 is not a prime number.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
